### Bug fixes
1. **Bugs**  
   If you've found a bug, please report it in the [issue tracker], after checking it has not been reported before - and possibly even fixed by now. If you think you can and have fixed it, feel free to do a pull request in the dev branch, I'll happily pull it if it looks all right to me - otherwise I'll gladly tell you what to change to get it merged.
